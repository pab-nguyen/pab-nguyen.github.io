Hi, I am Phan Nguyen. Welcome to my personal website. I am a self-taught data scientist. My previous education has been focusing on finance. Recently, I worked at Sunovion Pharmaceuticals as an intern for their Strategic Pricing department. I got to build these automation macros in Excel VBA, which reduce the average time spent for analysts from a few days to 20 minutes. Even though my job was mainly Excel and VBA related, it sparked something in me. I realized I want to work as data. I also remember a project I did in one of my Statistical Modeling class, where my team built a ML classification model to categorize cars by their MSRP prices and their market label (whether they are luxury/performance). These experiences, along with a lengthy research process, make me realized that statistics, programming and data are all things I am interested in. I am excited for this journey, and by creating this website, I am making the commitment to follow through.  

I have a BS and MS in Finance. I am proficient in R and Python programming languages, data processing with SQL. I am familiar with a handful of libraries like ggplot, dplyr for R and matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn for Python. Tableau is another of my trusted tool to deal with data visualization. Besides programming and visualization tools, I am advanced in Excel and VBA as well. I have built multiples VBA macros sets to automate reports, reducing significantly labor hours in my previous employment.
