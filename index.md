Hi, I am Phan Nguyen, a self-taught data scientist. Welcome to my website. This is where I'm showcasing my projects and portfolio. My areas of interest are [data science](https://pab-nguyen.github.io/portfolio/#machine-learning), [data anlytics](https://pab-nguyen.github.io/portfolio/#data-analytics), [equity valuation](https://pab-nguyen.github.io/portfolio/#equity-valuation), and [Excel VBA scripting](https://pab-nguyen.github.io/portfolio/#excel-vba).

### Overview
I recently finished my MS in Financial Analytic. I have experiences working in pharmaceuticals and asset managment industries. My most recent employment is at Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, where I work as an intern in the Strategic Pricing and Reimbursement department. This is one of the special departments in pharmaceuticals. During this internship, I had the opportunity to build financial models to quantify policies impact on firms, scripted VBA macros to automate report processes, co-created an improved intern program with other interns in my cohort. At this job, I had to constantly use Excel VBA and Microsoft Teams to communicate with management. 

I am proficient in R and Python programming languages, data processing with SQL. I am familiar with a handful of libraries like ggplot, dplyr for R and matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn for Python. Tableau is another of my trusted tool to deal with data visualization. 

Besides programming and visualization tools, I have substantial knowledge and experiences in corporate finance and I am advanced in Excel and VBA.I have worked as an investment analyst at an asset management firm. I have experiences with building complex financial models for equity valuation (DCF), capital budgeting, revenue forecasting, option pricing. Addtionally, I have built multiples VBA macros sets to automate reports, reducing significantly labor hours in my most previous employment. 

### Data Science Journey
I am currently learning data science by myself. I am reading [Introduction to Statistical Learnings](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370), taking [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=03-DataScience-JHU-US&utm_content=03-DataScience-JHU-US&campaignid=313639147&adgroupid=99651856256&device=c&keyword=udemy%20data%20science&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=426687804151&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=CjwKCAiAsOmABhAwEiwAEBR0ZuEZVtTe4IEeGiHwzDtI-ahodeNe2vV2HlK4KtQBQJ5apdtqXUta0xoCqfQQAvD_BwE) classes and working on new data science projects every week. 

My previous education has been focusing on finance. Last year, I had the chance to work at Sunovion Pharmaceuticals as an intern for their Strategic Pricing department. My responsibilities were to make financial models to estimate financial impact of new government policies changes. During the internship, I learned to build automation macros in Excel VBA, which reduced the average time spent for analysts from a few days to 20 minutes. This sparked something in me. I realized I like to code, and work with data. I also remember a project I did in one of my Statistical Modeling class, where my team built a [ML classification model](https://pab-nguyen.github.io/2019/11/28/car-classification.html) to categorize cars by their MSRP prices and their market label (whether they are luxury/performance). These experiences, along with a lengthy research process, make me realized that statistics, programming and data are all things I am highly interested in. I want to be a data scientist, and I am teaching myself how to become one. I am excited for this journey, and by creating this website, I am making the commitment to follow through.
