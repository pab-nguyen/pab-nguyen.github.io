### What I've done so far
I am working as a Data Analyst Intern at Sunovion Pharmaceuticals for the summer 2021. In this role, I got to work with the Decision Insights team to help the Marketing team to build a consolidated dashboard, which will be used as the single source of truth for all marketing data. My responsibility includes extracting data from different sources (Google Analytics, VAE/NPP Emails, IVA Calls, etc.) using SQL and Excel then push the data into Tableau to build the dashboard. 

I have worked as a Oracle NetSuite Analyst, where I assisted my employer to integrate Oracle NetSuite as their new ERP, built dashboards for executives, and facilitated training sessions for employees. Before that, I had interned at Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, in the Strategic Pricing and Contracting team. During this internship, I had the opportunity to build financial models to quantify financial impact of health policies changes, scripted VBA macros to automate reports, and co-designed an improved intern program with my colleagues. 

I have a MS degree in Finance and Data Analytics at Bentley University. I am proficient in R and Python programming languages, data processing with SQL. I am familiar with a handful of libraries like ggplot, dplyr for R and matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn for Python. 

My most trusted tool Tableau. I love the process of tinkering with data to find the best visual methods to tell the necessary story. My goal is to get on Tableau Viz of the Day one day. 

### What I'm working on

I am currently taking [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) courses on Coursera. I am also doing a Master program in Management and Data Analytics at University of North America.

I am in the process of switching careers from finance to data analytics. From working with programming and database in previous employments and academic courses, I realized data science, specifically data analytics is what I want to do. I am highly interested in coding, visualizing data and statistics. I want to be a data analyst, and I am teaching myself how to become one. I am excited for this journey, and by creating this website, I am making the commitment to follow through.
