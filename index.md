Hi, I am Phan Nguyen. Welcome to my website. This is where I'm showcasing my projects and portfolio.

### What I've done so far  
I am working as a Oracle NetSuite Analyst at a construction materials manufacturer. This SME recently implemented Oracle as their ERP system, and is in need of assistance with daily operations to ensure a smooth change from their legacy system. My responsibilities include assisting with the software operational issues, customizing front-end elements (forms, lists), updating data records and documenting changes and work instructions, and building dashboards for executives.   

My previous employment was at Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, where I worked as an intern in the Strategic Pricing and Reimbursement department. During this internship, I had the opportunity to build financial models to quantify financial impact of health policies changes on firms, scripted VBA macros to automate processes, and co-created an improved intern program with my colleagues. 

I have a MS degree in Finance and Data Analytics at Bentley University. I am proficient in R and Python programming languages, data processing with SQL. I am familiar with a handful of libraries like ggplot, dplyr for R and matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn for Python. Tableau is another of my trusted tool to create data visualization. 

Besides programming and visualization tools, I have substantial knowledge and experiences in corporate finance and I am advanced in Excel and VBA. I have worked as an investment analyst at an asset management firm. I have experiences with building complex financial models for equity valuation (DCF), capital budgeting, revenue forecasting, option pricing. Additionally, I have built multiples VBA macros sets to automate reports, reducing significantly labor hours in my previous jobs. 

### What I'm working on

I am currently taking [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) courses on Coursera. I am also doing a Master program in Management and Data Analytics at University of North America.

I am in the process of switching careers from finance to data analytics. From working with programming and database in previous employments and academic courses, I realized data science, specifically data analytics is what I want to do. I am highly interested in coding, visualizing data and statistics. I want to be a data analyst, and I am teaching myself how to become one. I am excited for this journey, and by creating this website, I am making the commitment to follow through.
