Hi, I am Phan Nguyen, a self-taught data scientist. Welcome to my personal website.   

Quick story: My previous education has been focusing on finance. From June to October 2020, I worked at Sunovion Pharmaceuticals as an intern for their Strategic Pricing department. My responsibilities were to make financial models to estimate financial impact of new government policies changes. During the internship, I learned, by chance, to build automation macros in Excel VBA, which reduce the average time spent for analysts from a few days to 20 minutes. This sparked something in me. I realized I like to code, and work with data. I also remember a project I did in one of my Statistical Modeling class, where my team built a ML classification model to categorize cars by their MSRP prices and their market label (whether they are luxury/performance). These experiences, along with a lengthy research process, make me realized that statistics, programming and data are all things I am interested in. I want to be a data scientist, and I am teaching myself how to become one. I am excited for this journey, and by creating this website, I am making the commitment to follow through.  

I have a BS and MS in Finance. I am proficient in R and Python programming languages, data processing with SQL. I am familiar with a handful of libraries like ggplot, dplyr for R and matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn for Python. Tableau is another of my trusted tool to deal with data visualization. 

Besides programming and visualization tools, I have substantial knowledge and experiences in corporate finance and I am advanced in Excel and VBA.I have worked as an investment analyst at an asset management firm. I have experiences with building complex financial models for equity valuation (DCF), capital budgeting, revenue forecasting, option pricing. Addtionally, I have built multiples VBA macros sets to automate reports, reducing significantly labor hours in my most previous employment.
