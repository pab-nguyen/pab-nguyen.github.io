I wrote this Excel VBA Script during one of my internships. The sales department usually keep a document to record meetings with clients, which they update on a weekly basis. They used Outlook to set up the meetings, then update it manually into this document. The manual update will take around a half hour every week. 

​

I have built a VBA script to automate this process. It allows users to extract the calendar from Outlook, under a .csv file, then extract the data from this .csv file into a template. This script reduces the process to only five minutes. You can watch the video to understand how it works.
