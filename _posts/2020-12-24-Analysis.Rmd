# Introduction

Hello everyone, welcome to an Analysis of my reading journey. A little bit of background: I started reading again in 2018, after a long time of not touching books. The last book I had read before was when I was in 8th grade :D. 

Since I started reading in 2018, I've been keeping track of the books I read, rating and reviews on Goodreads, and after two years, I had this small set of data available. I came across it the other day, when Goodreads showed me some stats on their website. 

Moreover, I recently started learning data science on my own, therefore I am so thrilled to analyze this data. My purpose of this analysis is to answer some simple exploratory and descriptive analysis questions:  
1. How much books I've read over the years ? Do I read more every year?  
2. I read books in Vietnamese and English? How many of those are Viet and how many are English?  
3. Are there correlation between time of year and the amount of reading ?  
4. Do I give better rating than other people do ?  
5. How fast do I read ?  

I am new to this, so if you have any comments or suggestions, please let me know!

LET'S DIVE IN!

# The Analysis

## The Goodreads Data
First, let grab our data
```{r class.source = "fold-show"}
# encoding UTF-8 since there are Vietnamese characters
data <- read.csv("data//goodreads_library_export.csv",encoding="UTF-8",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```  
  

```{r class.source = "fold-show"}
# call out dimensions of data
dim(data)
```
There are 57 books in this data. This include books I read, currently am reading, and going to read. This is a small data set, however I believe there are some interesting insights in this one.
Each of this book has 31 variables to describe it. 

This is a sample of the data set. The column **My.Review** is left out, due to the fact that it made the row height too large. There are also a lot of missing values. 
```{r }
#create a table
kable(data[,-which(names(data) %in% "My.Review")]) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width ="800px",height = "350px")
```


I will convert some variables to its proper data type.
```{r class.source = "fold-show"}
#turn variable into date
data$Date.Read <- as.Date(data$Date.Read)
data$Date.Added <- as.Date(data$Date.Added)
```

## Descriptive and Exploratory Analysis

### Books
```{r}
shelf1 <- as.data.frame(table(data$Exclusive.Shelf))
colnames(shelf1)[1] <- "Shelf"
kable(shelf1) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")
```  

I have read 51 books so far.  

We are only interested in looking at books I have read, therefore we will filter read books.

And also make make some variables less mouthful.

```{r}
# filter read books
rdata<-data %>% filter(Exclusive.Shelf=='read')
#easier to see
rdata <- as_tibble(rdata)

#make this variable sh
names(rdata)[names(data)=='Original.Publication.Year'] <- "opy"
```  

I am interested in seeing read books by year

```{r class.source = "fold-show"}
# create shelf 2, dataframe split books read by year
shelf2 <- rdata %>% group_by(year(Date.Read)) %>% select('year(Date.Read)') 
shelf2 <- as.data.frame(table(shelf2[,1]))
shelf2 <- mutate(shelf2,pct_change=round((Freq/lag(Freq)-1)*100,2))
colnames(shelf2) <- c("Year","Books Read","Percent Change")
```
```{r class.source = "fold-show"}
#create a table
kable(shelf2)%>%
    kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# ggplot(shelf2, aes(x=Year,y=Freq))+geom_col(fill="aquamarine4")+
#   geom_text(aes(label=Freq), vjust=-0.5)+
#   labs(y="Number of Books",title="Books Read per Year")+
#   ylim(0,25)
```



There was a big jump between 2018 and 2019 in terms of book read (111%). However, there was no significant change from 2019 to 2020 (21%). I'm reading more books each year, but at a decreasing rate.

Here are the oldest and newest books
```{r results="hold"}
#create a table with row as the title of the newest books, remove missing values
table <- tibble(rdata$Title[rdata$opy==max(na.omit(rdata$opy))&is.na(rdata$opy)==FALSE])
table[,2] <- rep(max(na.omit(rdata$opy),nrow(table)))
colnames(table) <- c("Newest books","Year")
kable(table) %>%
    kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")


#create a table with row as the title of the oldest books, remove missing values
table <- tibble(rdata$Title[rdata$opy==min(na.omit(rdata$opy))&is.na(rdata$opy)==FALSE])
table [,2] <- rep(min(na.omit(rdata$opy)),nrow(table))
colnames(table) <- c("Oldest books","Year")
kable(table) %>%
    kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")
```


Here are the thickest and thinnest books.  


  
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
table1 <- tibble(rdata$Title[which.max(rdata$Number.of.Pages)])
table1[,2] <- max(rdata$Number.of.Pages,na.rm = TRUE)
table1[2,1] <- rdata$Title[which.min(rdata$Number.of.Pages)]
table1[2,2] <-min(rdata$Number.of.Pages,na.rm=TRUE)
colnames(table1) <- c("Books", "No. of Pages")
kable(table1)%>%
    kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")

```


Lots of these books are Vietnamese, since I picked up some Viet books every time I vist home. With that being said, I did not expect the thickest book was a Viet. Now I want to know how often I read Viet books.  
  
### Viet books
To detect books which are in Vietnamese, we might need to install some different packages. I will use stringi in this case to detect some characters.

Thank to this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34613761/detect-non-ascii-characters-in-a-string) I was able to find this package and functions. 

```{r}
#call stringi packages
library(stringi)

#create a dataframe with title and their encoding
title <- tibble(Title=rdata$Title)
title$Encoding <- stri_enc_mark(title$Title)
kable(head(subset(title,title$Encoding=="UTF-8"),3)) %>%
    kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")
kable(head(subset(title,title$Encoding=="ASCII"),3))%>%
    kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")

```  
   
   
   
   
   
So we can assume that Viet titles are encoded with UTF-8, since they have some non-ASCII characters. Fortunately, we had a small dataset so I was able to check if I have left out any books. This might not hold true if a Viet book title has no non-ASCII character and we have a big data set. 

```{r class.source = "fold-show"}
# Number of books in Viet
title %>% filter(Encoding=="UTF-8")%>% nrow()
```
```{r class.source = "fold-show"}
# Number of books in English
title %>% filter(Encoding!="UTF-8")%>% nrow()
```

I read 26 books in Viet and 25 books in English. This is significantly different from what I expected, which is that I read more books in English than in Viet.

```{r}
# only find viet books
vietdata <- merge(rdata,title,by="Title")
vietdata <- vietdata %>% filter(Encoding=="UTF-8") %>% mutate(month=month.abb[month(Date.Read)])
vietdata <- as.data.frame(table(vietdata$month))
colnames(vietdata)[1] <- "Month"

#plot viet books by month
ggplot(vietdata,aes(x=Month,y=Freq))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = month.abb)+
  labs(x="Months",y="Number of books",title="Viet books read by months")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```  

This graph makes sense since January is when I finished the most Viet books. This might be because I went home for Christmas and New Year and grabbed some books to read for my flight. 

April, June and December are also months with second highest Viet books finished. I read some viet books in December so I can bring them home and put them on the shelves. I have no explanation for April and June. 


### Number of Pages

We will look at number of pages I've read. 
```{r}
datagraph <- rdata %>% mutate(month=floor_date(Date.Read,unit="month")) %>% group_by(month) %>% mutate(sumpages=sum(Number.of.Pages,na.rm = TRUE)) 
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
datagraph %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=month,y=sumpages))+
  geom_bar(position="dodge",
           stat="identity",
           fill="#00AFBB",width = 20) +
  geom_text(aes(label=sumpages),vjust=-.5,size=2.5)+
  labs(x="Months",y="Pages Read",title="Pages Read through time")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  ylim(0,1500)+
  scale_x_date(breaks="month",
               labels = function(x) ifelse(year(x)%in%c(2017,max(year(datagraph$month))+1),"", format(x,"%b %Y")), 
               limits=as.Date(c('2017-12-15', '2020-12-15')))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=60, hjust = 1))
```

As you can see, I'm not a consistent reader :D. 

Additionally, this represents how many pages of a book I finished in a certain month, rather than how much I read that month. Let's say if I started reading a 500-pages book in January and finished it in May, the 500 will be count in May. 

I haven't figured out a way to reflect the true number of pages read. I hope to do this in future analysis. 

```{r  warning=FALSE}
# create a year vector from the data
years <- as.integer(unique(year(data$Date.Read)))
years <- na.omit(years)
years <- sort(years, decreasing = FALSE)
# create a color vector for graph colors
colors <- c("deepskyblue","dodgerblue4","steelblue")
# create a vector for total number of pages read in a year
totalpages <- rep(0,length(years))
for (i in c(1:length(years))){
  totalpages[i] <- sum(data$Number.of.Pages[year(data$Date.Read)==years[i]],na.rm=TRUE)
}

#loop through years to create chart of pages read in each year
for (i in c(1:length(years))){
    print(datagraph %>% filter(year(Date.Read)==as.integer(years[i])) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=month,y=sumpages))+
    geom_bar(position="dodge",
             stat="identity",
             fill=colors[i]) +
    geom_text(aes(label=sumpages),vjust=-.5)+
    labs(x="Months",y="Pages Read",title=paste(totalpages[i]," pages read in ",years[i],sep=""))  +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
    ylim(0,1500)+
    scale_x_date(breaks="month",
                 labels = function(x) ifelse(year(x)!=years[i],"" , months(x, TRUE)),
                 limits=as.Date(c(paste(toString(years[i]-1),"-12-15",sep=""),paste(toString(years[i]),"-12-15",sep="")))
    )
    )
    }
                 
```  
  
In 2018, I didn't finish any book in February, March, April. Again, this only reflects the fact that I didn't finish any book, not that I was not reading. 

In 2019 and 2020, there are not a lot of empty months, since I read more frequently, thus finished books more often. I wonder if my speed also plays a role here.  

### Speed
Another information I want to know is how fast do I finish a book? 
I will create a variable in rdata, to calculate the speed.
Speed will equal to Number of pages divided by Days Difference or **datediff**.

**datediff** is calculated by taking Date Read minus Date Added
```{r}
# days to finish a book
rdata$datediff <- difftime(rdata$Date.Read,rdata$Date.Added,units = "day")
rdata$datediff
```
The disadvantage of Goodreads export data is that it only allows **Date Added** and **Date Read**. **Date Added** is the variable reflects when I added the book to my shelf, and **Date Read** reflects when I claimed to finish it. Normally, **Date Read** will be after **Date Added**, if I added on the day I started reading it, which results in a positive **datediff**. 

There are instances where I updated a book after I finished it, therefore **Date Read** will be before **Date Added**. The negative represents those cases. 

The 0s are the cases where I added the book right on the day I finished it.

There is another column called **Date Started** on Goodreads, but they don't allow you to export it. 


```{r class.source = "fold-show"}
#count datediff which smaller than 1
aggregate(rdata$datediff,list(rdata$datediff<1), FUN=length)
```

I will remove the 0 and the negative in order to calculate speed. 17 books will be removed

```{r}
rdata$speed  <- rdata$Number.of.Pages/as.integer(rdata$datediff)
speedat <- rdata%>% filter(speed>0&is.na(rdata$speed)==FALSE&speed!=Inf)

#average speed
mean(speedat$speed)
```  
  
My average reading speed is 33.31 pages/day

Let's look at it through year
```{r message=FALSE}
kable(speedat %>% group_by(year=year(Date.Read))%>%summarise(avgspeed = mean(speed,na.rm=TRUE))) %>%
      kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")

```


  
Average speed in 2018 somehow is the highest, despite the low number of books. Is it because of the number of pages per book?

```{r message=FALSE}
kable(speedat %>% group_by(year(Date.Read))%>%summarise(avgspeed = mean(speed,na.rm=TRUE),avgpages = mean(Number.of.Pages,na.rm=TRUE),n=n()) %>% mutate(true_n=shelf2$`Books Read`) %>% mutate(removed=true_n-n)) %>%
      kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")

```


  
The average number of pages in 2018 is actually higher than 2019 and 2020. 
From what I understand, I read less books in 2018, but in a short window. In 2020, I read more books, more frequently, but at slower pace. 

The removed data also play a part here. There are 3 books removed for 2018, 9 for 2019 and 5 for 2020. Even though 2020 has double the books of 2018, it might be that the books which are removed in 2020 have a really high number of pages.

Or I just read super fast in a short window in 2018. 


### Ratings & Reviews
#### Rating
I want to compare my ratings with average book rating
```{r class.source = "fold-show"}
#My rating 
mean(data$My.Rating)
```
```{r class.source = "fold-show"}
#Average rating
mean(data$Average.Rating)
```

```{r}
#creating a dataset of my rating versus average rating
ratedata<-aggregate(rdata$Average.Rating,list(myrating=rdata$My.Rating),FUN="mean")
ratedata$class <- ratedata$myrating
for (i in c(0:nrow(ratedata))){ratedata[i,3]<- ratedata$myrating[i]}
colnames(ratedata)[2] <-"avg"
ratedata <- gather(ratedata,var,value,myrating,avg)
```

```{r}
#plot it
ggplot(ratedata, aes(x=class,y=value,fill=var))+
  geom_bar(stat='identity',position='dodge')+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(value,2)),vjust=-.5,position=position_dodge(width=0.9))+
  labs(y="Rating",title="Books Rating: Phan's versus Average")+
  ylim(0,6)+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),legend.title=element_blank(),axis.title.x = element_blank(),axis.text.x = element_blank(),axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Average Rating", "My Rating"))
```

The 3-star books, which are "meh" in my opnions, seems to be preferred by others. On the other hand, books I found excellent - 5-stars books - are rated much lower. 

#### Reviews
Does thicker book has higher rating? Let's find out.
First, let's get a dataframe for **Number.of.Pages** and **Average.Rating**.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# dataframe for review length and my.rating
ratereview <- tibble(numpages = rdata$Number.of.Pages,rating = rdata$Average.Rating,title=rdata$Title)
ggplot(ratereview,aes(x=rating,y=numpages))+geom_point()
```

As first glance, there is no correlation here. The 4 star and five star books have somewhat the same length of reviews. There are some outliers for five stars reviews. And I rated only one book 3 stars.
```{r results="hold"}
cor.test(ratereview$numpages,ratereview$rating)
model <- lm(rating~numpages,data=ratereview)
summary(model)
```

It seems like **numpages** doesn't correlate to **rating** at all. The correlation coefficient is around -0.11, and the p-value for the predictor is large. Therefore rating and book thickness are independent. 


# Conclusion 
Let's summarize answers to the questions I asked at the beginning of this analysis:  
1. I read 51 books so far. And I do read more every year.  
2. Half of the books I read are Vietnamese.  
3. There are not a lot of correlation between time of year and amount of reading.  
4. Books I found 'meh' got higher rating from other people, and books I loved got lower rating.   
5. I read around 30 pages/day. 

Even though this analysis is mostly exploratory in essence, I found that it is a great exercise as a beginner. I also think there are a lot more to be done in the future. 

From this project, I learned that I need to put more time into exploring the data, before doing any type of analysis. I spent a lot of time making graphs and charts, because of not knowing syntax and not understanding data structures. The write-ups were quite short for the time I put into each graphs.

I could also learn more by reading other analyses on Goodreads data.  

This is one of my first projects I did on something I like. And I was surprised with the amount of time I put in it. It felt great. I'm gonna do this at the end of 2021 as well.
