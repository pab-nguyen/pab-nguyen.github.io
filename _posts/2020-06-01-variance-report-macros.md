One of my biggest Excel VBA scripts written to date. ​

There is a common process in drug manufacturing, where after they sold their products to customers, they reimburse them. Customers will usually send in an invoice, claiming they should get a reimbursement based on the percentage written in the contract. Manufacturers will analyze these claims, and then issue a report to state whether the claim is valid, and then issue a reimbursement. This is called Variance Reporting.

​

This reporting process often takes 2 - 3 days from the day they receive the claims, depends on the client size and the quantities of brands they bought. I have built a VBA script to automate this reporting process, reducing it to 30 minutes on average.
